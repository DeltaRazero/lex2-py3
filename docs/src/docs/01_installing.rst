Installing
==========

As per usual, you can install the library from the Python Package Index (PyPI) through ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install lex2


You can also choose to manually include the library in your project by cloning or downloading a snapshot of the repository from GitHub and copying the ``lex2`` folder to your project's includes/libraries folder.
